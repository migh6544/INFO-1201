# INFO-1201
Computational Thinking with Python and Scratch



Course Focus:

Computing and information technologies permeate all aspects of our lives.
They inspire how we connect with each other online through social networks and how we find information through search engines.
Technologies also drive our physical world in how we navigate transportation systems and how we manage money on banking applications.
Everyone should have the ability to not only use and interact with computing, but to also create and express themselves with computing.
This course is a hands-on introduction to create, invent, and build with computer programming. No programming experience is necessary and all backgrounds are welcome. Students will become exposed to high-level computational concepts and practices that include algorithms, data, parallelism, abstraction, and debugging.
Assignments and projects will involve learning to program using the Scratch and Python programming languages.
The creative and problem-solving strategies introduced in this course are applicable across many domains beyond information and computer sciences.
 
 
Course Objectives:

● Develop and utilize Computational Thinking concepts, practices, and perspectives to create, explore, and understand the world in new ways.
  In this class, you will engage with computational thinking through creative expression with computer programming.
  These concepts, practices, and perspectives are applicable beyond this class into other domains and interests beyond computing.
● Create and share interactive media projects, such as animations, games, and stories with Scratch and Python
● Collect, examine, and interpret large datasets with Python
● Connect the ways that computing interacts with many part of our lives
● Learn about opportunities that exist to extend and expand on the practices and activities in this class within and beyond
